# Overview

HelloWorld is a simple Python program that prints a "ðŸŽ‰ Hello World!" message to the console after a specified number of seconds.

This simple program demonstrates a basic way to use the time module in Pytho to perform a countdown. Also, it uses the range function to generate the numbers from the specified number in the function.

Lastly, this program is intended to be used as a starting point in my Python learning journey.
